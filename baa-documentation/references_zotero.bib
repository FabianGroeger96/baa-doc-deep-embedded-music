	abstract = {This paper investigates the most accent-sensitive words for Malaysian English (MalE) speakers in multi-resolution 13 Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. A text-independent accent system was implemented using different numbers of Mel-filters to determine the optimal settings for this database. Then, text-dependent accent systems were developed to rank the most accent-sensitive words for MalE speakers according to the classification rates. Prior work has also been conducted to test the significance of the wordlist for both gender and accent factors, and to investigate any interaction between these two factors. Experimental results show that male speakers have a higher intensity of accent effects compared with female speakers by 3.91\% on text-independent and 3.47\% on text-dependent tasks. Another finding has proven that by selecting appropriate words that carry severe accent markers could improve the task of speaker accent classification. An improvement of at most 8.45\% and 8.91\% was achieved on the male and female datasets, respectively, following vocabulary selection.},

However, removing the babble without creating artifacts in human speech is a challenging task in a low SNR environment. Here, we sought to solve the problem by finding a `mapping' between noisy speech spectra and clean speech spectra via supervised learning. Specifically, we propose using fully Convolutional Neural Networks, which consist of lesser number of parameters than fully connected networks. The proposed network, Redundant Convolutional Encoder Decoder (R-CED), demonstrates that a convolutional network can be 12 times smaller than a recurrent network and yet achieves better performance, which shows its applicability for an embedded system: the hearing aids.},

	abstract = {There is a rising interest in monitoring and improving human wellbeing at home using different types of sensors including microphones. In the context of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) persons are monitored, e.g. to support patients with a chronic illness and older persons, by tracking their activities being performed at home. When considering an acoustic sensing modality, a performed activity can be seen as an acoustic scene. Recently, acoustic detection and classification of scenes and events has gained interest in the scientific community and led to numerous public databases for a wide range of applications. However, no public databases exist which a) focus on daily activities in a home environment, b) contain activities being performed in a spontaneous manner, c) make use of an acoustic sensor network, and d) are recorded as a continuous stream. In this paper we introduce a database recorded in one living home, over a period of one week. The recording setup is an acoustic sensor network containing thirteen sensor nodes, with four low-cost microphones each, distributed over five rooms. Annotation is available on an activity level. In this paper we present the recording and annotation procedure, the database content and a discussion on a baseline detection benchmark. The baseline consists of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Support Vector Machine and a majority vote late-fusion scheme. The database is publicly released to provide a common ground for future research.},

More precisely, the skip-gram version of word2vec is used to model slices of music from a large corpus spanning eight musical genres. In this newly learned vector space, a metric based on cosine distance is able to distinguish between functional chord relationships, as well as harmonic associations in the music. Evidence, based on cosine distance between chord-pair vectors, suggests that an implicit circle-of-fifths exists in the vector space. In addition, a comparison between pieces in different keys reveals that key relationships are represented in word2vec space. These results suggest that the newly learned embedded vector representation does in fact capture tonal and harmonic characteristics of music, without receiving explicit information about the musical content of the constituent slices. In order to investigate whether proximity in the discovered space of embeddings is indicative of ‘semantically-related’ slices, we explore a music generation task, by automatically replacing existing slices from a given piece of music with new slices. We propose an algorithm to find substitute slices based on spatial proximity and the pitch class distribution inferred in the chosen subspace. The results indicate that the size of the subspace used has a significant effect on whether slices belonging to the same key are selected. In sum, the proposed word2vec model is able to learn music-vector embeddings that capture meaningful tonal and harmonic relationships in music, thereby providing a useful tool for exploring musical properties and comparisons across pieces, as a potential input representation for deep learning models, and as a music generation device.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

representations useful for a given task from raw input data. In terms of
overall performance metrics, machine learning solutions employing deep
representations frequently have been reported to greatly outperform those using
hand-crafted feature representations. At the same time, they may pick up on
aspects that are predominant in the data, yet not actually meaningful or
interpretable. In this paper, we therefore propose a systematic way to test the
trustworthiness of deep music representations, considering musical semantics.
The underlying assumption is that in case a deep representation is to be
trusted, distance consistency between known related points should be maintained
both in the input audio space and corresponding latent deep space. We generate
known related points through semantically meaningful transformations, both
considering imperceptible and graver transformations. Then, we examine within-
and between-space distance consistencies, both considering audio space and
latent embedded space, the latter either being a result of a conventional
feature extractor or a deep encoder. We illustrate how our method, as a
complement to task-specific performance, provides interpretable insight into
what a network may have captured from training data signals.},

Second, we employ reinforcement learning is to learn user preferences from their song playing log. Experimental results confirm, that hybrid features are superior to audio or lyrics based features for content recommendation, largely because independent audio features significantly outperform lyrics features; and reinforcement learning improves personalized recommendations.

In this paper we present a system, called FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings as feature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128-bytes per face. On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63\%. On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12\%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result by 30\% on both datasets. We also introduce the concept of harmonic embeddings, and a harmonic triplet loss, which describe different versions of face embeddings (produced by different networks) that are compatible to each other and allow for direct comparison between each other.},

	abstract = {Recent neural models have shown significant progress on the problem of generating short descriptive texts conditioned on a small number of database records. In this work, we suggest a slightly more difﬁcult data-to-text generation task, and investigate how effective current approaches are on this task. In particular, we introduce a new, large-scale corpus of data records paired with descriptive documents, propose a series of extractive evaluation methods for analyzing performance, and obtain baseline results using current neural generation methods. Experiments show that these models produce ﬂuent text, but fail to convincingly approximate humangenerated documents. Moreover, even templated baselines exceed the performance of these neural models on some metrics, though copy- and reconstructionbased extensions lead to noticeable improvements.},
